## About the Challenge

Building **10 AI Voice Agents over 10 Days** using **Murf Falcon** – the consistently fastest TTS API!

This is Day 1 of the **#MurfAIVoiceAgentsChallenge** #10DaysofAIVoiceAgents

## Repository Structure

This is a **monorepo** that contains both the backend and frontend for building voice agent applications. It's designed to be your starting point for each day's challenge task.

### Backend

The backend is based on [LiveKit's agent-starter-python](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-python) with modifications to integrate **Murf Falcon TTS** for ultra-fast, high-quality voice synthesis.

**Features:**

- Complete voice AI agent framework using LiveKit Agents
- Murf Falcon TTS integration for fastest text-to-speech
- LiveKit Turn Detector for contextually-aware speaker detection
- Background voice cancellation
- Integrated metrics and logging
- Complete test suite with evaluation framework
- Production-ready Dockerfile

[→ Backend Documentation](./backend/README.md)

### Frontend

The frontend is based on [LiveKit's agent-starter-react](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-react), providing a modern, beautiful UI for interacting with your voice agents.

**Features:**

- Real-time voice interaction with LiveKit Agents
- Camera video streaming support
- Screen sharing capabilities
- Audio visualization and level monitoring
- Light/dark theme switching
- Highly customizable branding and UI

- **uv package manager**: `pip install uv`
- **Node.js 18+** with **pnpm**: `npm install -g pnpm`
- **LiveKit Server**: Download from [LiveKit Releases](https://github.com/livekit/livekit/releases)

### Required API Keys

- **MURF_API_KEY** - Get from [Murf.ai](https://murf.ai/api)
- **GOOGLE_API_KEY** - Get from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
- **DEEPGRAM_API_KEY** - Get from [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com/)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GhanshyamJha05/first_day_Task-Murf-AI-.git
cd first_day_Task-Murf-AI-
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Install dependencies (use Python 3.11 or 3.12)
uv sync --python 3.11

# Create .env.local file with your API keys
# Copy from .env.example and add:
LIVEKIT_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:7880
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=devkey
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=secret
MURF_API_KEY=<your-murf-api-key>
GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your-google-api-key>
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=<your-deepgram-api-key>

# Download required models
uv run python src/agent.py download-files
```

For LiveKit Cloud users, you can automatically populate credentials:

```bash
lk cloud auth
lk app env -w -d .env.local
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../frontend

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Create .env.local file
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=devkey
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=secret
LIVEKIT_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:7880
```

### 4. Download and Run LiveKit Server

**Download LiveKit Server:**
- Visit [LiveKit Releases](https://github.com/livekit/livekit/releases)
